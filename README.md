# City Weather Dashboard


Deployment date: 10/11/22</br>
Deployed address: https://sarahthoorens.github.io//</br>
Topics applied: Bootstrap, jQuery, javascript, HTML, CSS, local and third-party API</br>
Project goal: Create a weather application that pulls forecast for specified city

## Project Description

Create a weather dashboard that pulls from OpenWeather's API and shows the 5 day forecast of a user-inputed city. 


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
```

## Project review

I did not spend as much time as I'd haved liked on this project, but I did in fact enjoy the work I did. APIs were a little scary at first, but I can see how working with them more regularly will make future API projects much easier. I think when I have the time to work on this in the future, I'll find it to be one of my more enjoyable projects. 


**Challenges**

This project is unfinished. Figuring out how to gather the lat/lon data of a city and then gather the city forecast based on the coordinates was extremely time consuming. With the group project now coming due, I decided to leave this application incomplete to return to post-bootcamp. Had I reprioritized this challenge in lieu of the group project, I'm confident it would have been completed by tonight. I did not get to the local storage bit of this project, either. 


**Lessons learned**

Thanks to the enormous amount of time I spent testing every possible API variation, I do feel like I have a firmer grasp on how to install and manipulate server-side APIs. Going forward, I will need to begin projects earlier to complete them in full by deadline.
